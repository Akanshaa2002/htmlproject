<h3 id = "#one">January Birth Flowers - Carnation and Snowdrop</h3>
<img src="january.webp" alt="error">
<p>The first month of the year is the carnation and the second is the snowdrop. The carnation's meaning depends on the colour. Pink means affection, red means love, white means pure love, striped carnations mean regretful love that isn't shared/returned, and yellow indicates rejection or disappointment. If you want to celebrate any January babies, stick with pink, red or white. The snowdrop is a unique white flower that stands for hope and beauty.</p>
<h3 id ="two">February Birth Flowers - Violet and Primrose</h3>
<img src="february.webp" alt="error">
<p>The two flowers for February may surprise you. One of them isn't a rose as you might have expected with Valentine's Day falling in February! Rather, violet and primrose are the birth flowers for this month. These two purple flowers represent loyalty and faithfulness. If you're not thrilled with either as a birth flower, a third birth flower that is often mentioned for this month is the iris</p>
<h3 id ="three"> March Birth Flowers - Daffodil and Jonquil</h3>
<img src="march.webp" alt="error">
<p>These two flowers are members of the same family and generally look very similar. The yellow blooms are so spring-like that if you live anywhere snowy, you'll be praying for them to arrive each spring to signal the end of cold weather. Their meaning is "unequal love." Fitting for spring, they're associated with rebirth.</p>
<h3 id ="four">April Birth Flowers - Daisy and Sweet Pea</h3>
<img src="april.webp" alt="error">
<p>More spring flowers coming your way! Daisies and sweet peas are the official flowers of the month of April, and they couldn't' seem more perfect. Daisies mean innocence, loyal love, and purity. Sweet pea means blissful pleasure.</p>
<h3 id ="fivel">May Birth Flowers - Lily of the Valley and Hawthorn</h3>
<img src="may.webp" alt="error">
<p>Everything should be in bloom by the time May rolls around. If you're a May baby, your special flowers are Lily of the Valley and Hawthorn. These are incredibly unique flowers that really add something special to any arrangement. Lily of the Valley means sweetness, humility, and "return to happiness." Hawthorn means hope and supreme happiness. Pretty great flowers to have for your birth month!</p>
<h3 id ="six">June Birth Flowers - Rose and Honeysuckle</h3>
<img src="june.webp" alt="error">
<p>You wondered where it was in February and now it has finally appeared. The month of June has the world's favourite flower of the rose as its birth flower. Just like carnations, the different colours of the rose represent different things. Pink roses mean perfect happiness. Red roses mean love. White is a sign of purity. Yellow roses are a sign of jealousy. Honeysuckle is a representation of the everlasting bonds of love.</p>
<h3 id ="seven">July Birth Flowers - Larkspur and Water Lily</h3>
<img src="july.webp" alt="error">
<p>Dainty larkspur are such beautiful flowers to have as your birth flower if you are born in the month of July! They are used to show your "strong bonds of love," which can be quite powerful depending on your chosen recipient. Water lilies mean purity and majesty.</p>
<h3 id ="eight">August Birth Flowers - Gladiolus and Poppy</h3>
<img src="August.webp" alt="error">
<p>This is another month that is a little mixed up. While you may have thought that the poppy would have been the May birth flower since we honour veterans with poppies in May, it is, in fact, the August birth flower. It also has different meanings for each colour. Red poppies are meant for pleasure, white for consolation, and yellow for wealth and success. Gladiolus had a variety of meanings, which means you can use it whichever way suits you best! Remembrance, calm, integrity, and infatuation are all among its interpreted meanings.</p>
<h3 id ="nine">September Birth Flowers - Aster and Morning Glory</h3>
<img src="september.webp" alt="error">
<p>Spread the love, September babies! Your birth flowers are powerful and revolve around all things love. Aster means love and positivity for all. Morning glory means love and affection for someone close to you.</p>
<h3 id ="ten">October Birth Flowers - Marigold and Cosmos</h3>
<img src="october.webp" alt="error">
<p>October gets some of the most vibrant flowers out there for their birth month. Marigolds are interpreted as a sign of optimism and prosperity. Cosmos indicate that the recipient should feel harmony and serenity.</p>
<h3 id ="eleven">November Birth Flowers - Chrysanthemums</h3>
<img src="november.webp" alt="error">
<p>Unlike all the other months, November only gets one flower. Is this a good or bad thing? You decide! On the one hand, perhaps you don't get to choose between the two flowers for which one you like best, but on the other hand, you get to truly embrace the chrysanthemums as your own. They come in a variety of colours, which means that you get a ton of different meanings. Red means (you guessed it) love. White is for pure love. Yellow means slighted love â€“ poor yellow can never catch a break!</p>
<h3 id ="twelve">December Birth Flowers - Narcissus and Holly</h3>
<img src="december.webp" alt="error">
<p>Finally, a flower that fits with its month! Holly had to go in December because of the holidays that it represents. It means domestic happiness when gifted to one another. Poinsettias are also largely associated with this month. Narcissus is a beautiful white and yellow flower that tells your beloved that you love them just the way you are. What a perfect way to spend the holidays!</p>
